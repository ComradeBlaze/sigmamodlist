**This readme was created by me to keep track of mods when migrating between versions.** 

Occasionally I give it out when recommending mods to people and stuff.

Links might be broken, contact me if anything - @comradeblaze on discord.

**All mods are clientside and *should* work together.**
*YMMV, but they work for me hey :3*
